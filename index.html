  <h3 class="astro-MJXMPBKS">Hi!</h3>
  <pre class="astro-CGFIYD2U">I&#39;m Tobias, a passionate Software (Web) Developer and Tech Lead since over 10 years. Even though my focus has been the frontend side of web applications, especially using TypeScript and React, I always enjoyed the chance to look beyond that and be more involved in a fullstack scope.

Beyond coding, what I enjoy most, is taking ownership of the critical technical challenges and ensuring that the company vision is reflected in architecture and code, while enabling my team to work as efficiently as they can.</pre>

❹ Clear the path of obstacles for the team ⟶ the team is king
❺ Share knowledge within your team and beyond</pre>
