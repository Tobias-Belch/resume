## 4. Manifest constraints, make decisions and document risks

[➜ Architecture/Constraints](./architecture.md#2-architecture-constraints)

[➜ Architecture/Solution Strategy](./architecture.md#3-solution-strategy)

[➜ Architecture/Decisions](./architecture.md#4-architecture-decisions)

[➜ Architecture/Risks and Technical Debts](./architecture.md#5-risks-and-technical-debts)

## 5. Documenting the Domain Language

[➜ Architecture/Domain Language](./architecture.md#6-domain-language)

It is important for clarifying the used terms, stored in the [Glossary](./architecture.md#62-glossary) and it helps identifying the applications [Contexts](./architecture.md#61-contexts). The [Domain (Ubiquitous) Language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html) is at the core of [Domain Driven Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html), which improves the teams ability to align the technical implementation with the stakeholders knowledge and communicate about it.

## 6. Write the application
